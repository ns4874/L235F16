I was born, July 10th 1996 in San Antonio, Texas, but have been moving most of my life.  Currently I am living in my 5th different state, though if you could Bard it would be 6.<br>
I reside now just outside of Northhampton, Massachusetts with my parents and sister and my furry friends, Tucker (golden), Sidney (Australian Shepard) and Amigo (Tiger Cat).<br><br>

At Bard, I major in physics and hope to one day delve deeper into the field of Engineering.  My passion however has always been on the field.
I am a starter and one of the captains on the Men's Soccer team at Bard and hope to continue to improve the program as the years go by.<br><br>

Just recently our head Coach, Andy McCabe passed away and we stand together this season as we look to play in his name and make Bard Atheletics history.<br><br>
