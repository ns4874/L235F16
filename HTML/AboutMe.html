I was born, July 10th 1996 in San Antonio, Texas, but have been moving most of my life.  Currently I am living in my 5th different state, though if you could Bard it would be 6.<br>
I reside now just outside of Northhampton, Massachusetts with my parents and sister and my furry friends, Tucker (golden), Sidney (Australian Shepard) and Amigo (Tiger Cat).<br><br>

At Bard, I major in physics and hope to one day delve deeper into the field of Engineering.  My passion however has always been on the field.
I am a starter and one of the captains on the Men's Soccer team at Bard and hope to continue to improve the program as the years go by.
Just recently our head Coach, Andy McCabe passed away and we stand together this season as we look to play in his name and make Bard Atheletics history.<br><br>
