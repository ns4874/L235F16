Around "in sickness or in health",<br>
They come and go like the seasons.<br><br>
Sports can create them,<br>
While advil prevent them.<br><br>
Loud music, yelling or too much booze,<br>
All are sources to your problem.<br><br>
The best ones last but a moment,<br>
The worst can be turned into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nyI7GwQqv0" song.</a><br><br>
Age has no bounds,<br>
When you get achy either way.<br><br>
