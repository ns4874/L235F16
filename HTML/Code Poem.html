<br><br><br><b><b><u>Headaches</u></b><br><br>

Around <i>in sickness or in health,</i><br>
I come in complete and utter stealth.<br><br>
Sports can create me,<br>
While advil subside me.<br><br>
I can come out with too much booze,<br>
Or even without enough snooze.<br><br>
Some say this happens when you get a bang,<br>
The worst can be described by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nyI7GwQqv0"> musical twang</a>.<br><br>
With me, age has no bounds<br>
Cause when I hit you, your head pounds.<br><br>
